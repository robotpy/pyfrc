    .. warning:: These drivetrain models are not particularly realistic, and
                 if you are using a tank drive style drivetrain you should use
                 the :class:`.TankModel` instead.

    Based on input from various drive motors, these helper functions
    simulate moving the robot in various ways. Many thanks to
    `Ether <http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/member.php?u=34863>`_
    for assistance with the motion equations.
      
    When specifying the robot speed to the below functions, the following
    may help you determine the approximate speed of your robot:
    
    * Slow: 4ft/s
    * Typical: 5 to 7ft/s
    * Fast: 8 to 12ft/s
        
    Obviously, to get the best simulation results, you should try to
    estimate the speed of your robot accurately.
    
    Here's an example usage of the drivetrains::
    
        from pyfrc.physics import drivetrains
    
        class PhysicsEngine:
            
            def __init__(self, physics_controller):
                self.physics_controller = physics_controller
                self.drivetrain = drivetrains.TwoMotorDrivetrain(deadzone=drivetrains.linear_deadzone(0.2))
                
            def update_sim(self, hal_data, now, tm_diff):
                # TODO: get motor values from hal_data
                speed, rotation = self.drivetrain.get_vector(l_motor, r_motor)
                self.physics_controller.drive(speed, rotation, tm_diff)
                
                # optional: compute encoder
                # l_encoder = self.drivetrain.l_speed * tm_diff

        Real motors won't actually move unless you give them some minimum amount
        of input. This computes an output speed for a motor and causes it to
        'not move' if the input isn't high enough. Additionally, the output is
        adjusted linearly to compensate.
        
        Example: For a deadzone of 0.2:
        
        * Input of 0.0 will result in 0.0
        * Input of 0.2 will result in 0.0
        * Input of 0.3 will result in ~0.12
        * Input of 1.0 will result in 1.0

        returned function to one of the drivetrain simulation functions as the
