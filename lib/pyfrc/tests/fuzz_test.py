"""
    The purpose of the fuzz 'test' is not exactly to 'do' anything, but
    rather it mashes the buttons and switches in various completely
    random ways to try and find any possible control situations and
    such that would probably never *normally* come up, but.. well,
    given a bit of bad luck, could totally happen.
    
    Keep in mind that the results will totally different every time
    you run this, so if you find an error, fix it -- but don't expect
    that you'll be able to duplicate it with this test. Instead, you
    should design a specific test that can trigger the bug, to ensure
    that you actually fixed it.
