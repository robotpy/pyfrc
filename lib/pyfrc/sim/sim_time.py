        This allows the robot to run in realtime, or we can pause and
        single-step the robot.
    
        This implementation will break anything that is trying to measure
        time while paused.. but really, that shouldn't be expected to
        work anyways.
        
        Currently, we assume all robot code runs in a single thread. This
        makes a lot of things easier. If that assumption was broken, then
        this would be a bit more complex.
