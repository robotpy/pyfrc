"""
pyfrc uses the pint library in some places for representing physical
quantities to allow users to specify the physical parameters of their robot
in a natural and non-ambiguous way. For example, to represent 5 feet::

    from pyfrc.physics.units import units

    five_feet = 5 * units.feet

Unfortunately, actually using the quantities is a huge performance hit, so
we don't use them to perform actual physics computations. Instead, pyfrc uses
them to convert to known units, then performs computations using
the magnitude of the quantity.

pyfrc defines the following custom units:

* ``counts_per_minute`` or ``cpm``: Counts per minute, which should be used
  instead of pint's predefined ``rpm`` (because it is rad/s). Used to
  represent motor free speed
* ``N_m``: Shorthand for N-m or newton-meter. Used for motor torque.

* ``tm_ka``: The kA value used in the tankmodel (uses imperial units)
* ``tm_kv``: The kV value used in the tankmodel (uses imperial units)

Refer to the `pint documentation <https://pint.readthedocs.io>`_ for more
information on how to use pint.
